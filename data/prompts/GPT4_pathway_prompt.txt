I want you to behave as a professionist medicinal chemist. Our goal will be to model as precisely as possible the response of cancer cell lines to drugs. I will give you a function containing all feasible Reactome Functional Interactions pathways, the drug name, it's declared targets and a short summary  of a drug indicated mechanisms of action (MOA) and its metabolism. Your goal will be to return a list of 15 pathways that are most likely to modulate the efficacy of the given drug and its MOA (order them by importance, most important on top). For each pathway give coincise but precise biological explaination of why it was chosen.'''
